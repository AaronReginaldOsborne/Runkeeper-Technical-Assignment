# Runkeeper-Technical-Assignment
Runkeeper technical assignment for displaying badges

The test is to build this page below. It’s a standard trophy case (Grid view) that we recently implemented in Runkeeper and will be launched in the next version of the app. You have as much time as you’d like to complete the test but please don’t spend  more then 8 hours on it in total. It’s ok to hard code/pseudo code things to save time. You can also do whatever you want to explain what you would do if you had more time. Keep in mind the next phase of the interview process will be a technical interview and will be a discussion of the work done during this test.
